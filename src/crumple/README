Crumple is for full-funnel folding of RNA secondary structures.

Crumple expects GNU make; building is as simple as:

> make

To truly fold a full funnel, pipe crumple a sequence; no options are necessary:

> echo "GCUCUAAAAGAGAG" | ./crumple 

Crumple can also accept input from a file:

> ./crumple -i sequence.seq

Various filters are available to reduce the (admittedly expansive)
output, includeing removing structures that contain lonely
pairs. obeying the constraints of chemical modification and
covariation data, and the number and type of helices. For more
information about all of these options, read the usage message:

> ./crumple --help

Crumple can be run serially, on a single machine, or in parallel, using
MPI. To compile for parallel execution, ensure that libMPI is
available, and:

> make mpi

Crumple's parallel implementation is well-tuned, and for problems that
take more than a few minutes, you should experience linear speedup.
